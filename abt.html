<h4>What is metro mobile?</h4>
metro mobile is a mobile-optimized front end to <a href="http://metro.kingcounty.gov/">King County Metro's</a> online <a href="http://tripplanner.kingcounty.gov/cgi-bin/itin_page.pl">Trip Planner</a>.  It implements many enhancements including the ability to:
<ul>
<li>Store Locations</li>
<li>Find location via GPS</li>
<li>Select default trip options (e.g. If you need an accessable route, how far you're willing to walk, or if you prefer the fastest trip, the fewest transfers, or the least amount of walking.)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Who wrote metro mobile?</h4>
metro mobile was written by <a href="http://www.inmff.net">Nicholas Barnard</a>.  The logo was designed by <a href="http://www.adonisphotos.com">Brad Kevelin</a>.  Testing, feedback, and a multitude of support was provided by Benjamin Schwartz, Brad Kevelin, Ian Jaffe, and Lisa Templeton.

<h4>My phone has built in transit directions using Google Maps.  Why did you bother with metro mobile?</h4>
Many people have found the transit directions as provided by Google Maps just don't make sense in the real world, and it produces directions that an actual transit rider wouldn't consider as an acceptable itinerary.

<h4>How much does metro mobile cost?</h4>
metro mobile is free, although donations are accepted via <a href="javascript:document.nmPayPal.submit();">PayPal</a>.  If you find metro mobile useful, please consider a donation.  Significant time, as well as hosting costs, and many many extra pots of tea and coffee beverages at cafes around the area have been invested into its development.

<h4>How can I add, save, edit, or reorder usual stops?</h4>
You can add, save, edit, or reorder frequent starting and ending locations by going to <a href="/pref.html">preferences</a>.

<h4>How can I always get an itinerary that only has up to a quarter mile walk?  How do I always get an accessible trip?</h4>
You can manage your default trip preferences by tapping trip defaults in <a href="/pref.html">preferences</a>.

<h4>How can I select 7:05am or 4:20pm as my arrival or departure time?</h4>
You can manage the time intervals offered by tapping trip defaults in <a href="/pref.html">preferences</a> and changing time interval to your desired interval.  (e.g. If you wanted every 5 minutes to display you'd set time interval to 5, or if you wanted only every 20 minutes to display, you'd set time interval to 20.)

<h4>I want to plan a trip two weeks out, how do I select the right date?</h4>
By default metro mobile display a week of dates, starting with today.  If you'd like to have fewer or less days displayed, you can adjust this by tapping trip defaults in <a href="/pref.html">preferences</a> and changing days displayed the desired number of days you would like to have displayed.  You can display as few as two days, or as many as 31.

<h4>How does metro mobile handle my data?</h4>

<h4>metro mobile said I was somewhere where I wasn't, what happened?</h4>
The process involved with identifying the specific location of a phone or computer on the planet is complex.  If you believe the wrong location was returned, please go to additional options and set "save location debug info" to "yes", and retry your request.  After repeating your request, please submit a <a href="locationerror.html">location error report</a>. 

<h4>How do I tell all my friends about metro mobile?</h4>
There are many ways, you can email them a link to http://metromobile.info, tweet them with <a href="http://twitter.com/metro_mobile">@metro_mobile</a>, or suggest it to them on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Introducing-metro-mobile/109707232429391">Facebook</a>.  Oh, and you can also just tell them about it in person, "metro mobile dot info" its quick and easy to say!

<h4>How have you made metro mobile load quickly? (Or I'm a geek and want to know about all the design decisions!)</h4>
There were many design and configuration decisions that went into optimizing metro mobile, learn about them in the <a href="geekfaq.html">geek's FAQ</a>.

<h4>I'm thinking about suing you, because metro mobile provided the wrong location, which caused me to be late to a job interview, so I didn't get my job making $200k per year.  Now, I won't be able to send my kids to private school, and they'll forever be disadvantaged!</h4>
